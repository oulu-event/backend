# Steps to do before starting the project
1) Create a `.env` file with your local database data. Use the template below when creating, replace the data with your own.
      DB_USER = your user
      DB_HOST = your host
      DB_NAME = your DB name
      DB_PASSWORD = your password
      DB_PORT = your port

2) Run the command `npm install` in the command line to install all the required dependencies.
