# Steps to do before starting the project
1) Create a `.env` file with your local database data. Use the template below when creating, replace the data with your own.
           
    PORT = someport
    DB_HOST = yourhost
    DB_USER = youruser
    DB_NAME = yourdb
    DB_PASS = yourpassword
    DB_PORT= yourdbport
    SECRET_KEY= somekey


2) Run the command `npm install` in the command line to install all the required dependencies.

3) In pgAdmin 4 use the query tool to run the `database.sql` file in your database to create the necessary tables.
