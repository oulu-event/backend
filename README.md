# Group K Project - Event Manager Back-end

# Steps to do before starting the project

1. Create a `.env` file with your local database data. Use the template below when creating, replace the data with your own.

   PORT = yourport (3000 for example)
   DB_HOST = yourhost (localhost for example)
   DB_USER = youruser (postgres for example)
   DB_NAME = yourdb (event_manager for example)
   DB_PASS = yourpassword (root for example)
   DB_PORT= yourdbport (5000 for example)
   SECRET_KEY= somekey (key2 for example)

2. Run the command `npm install` in the command line to install all the required dependencies.

3. In pgAdmin 4 use the query tool to run the `database.sql` file in your database to create the necessary tables.
